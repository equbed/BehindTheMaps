See <a href='https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=db05d4f32e6145669e9d39f0ab258b67&rmedium=links_esri_com_0_a&rsource=https%3A%2F%2Flinks.esri.com%2Fagol-help%2Flesson%2Fenable-notebooks'>here for directions.</a></p>"

    "question": "Creating a New Notebook",
    "answer": "<p><i>Note: To do this, you MUST be an administrator on the site.</i></p><h1>Step 1</h1><p>Log into your ArcGIS Account. Select Notebook from the top menu bar.</p><img src='images/Notebook.png' alt='Select Notebook from top menu bar'><p>If you do not see Notebook as an option, confirm that you are an administrator for that site. Only administrators can see the Notebook tools.</p><h1>Step 2</h1><p>Click +New Notebook and select 'standard.'</p><img src='images/New Notebook Menu.png' alt='Press the +New Notebook button and select Standard.'><h3>Step 3</h3><p>As with anything on AGOL, Notebooks do not save automatically. Be sure to save often.</p><p>First, give your notebook a name by clicking Save > Save As on the right.</p><img src='images/Creating a New Notebook.png' alt='Select Notebook from top menu bar'><p><i>Give it a moment to save. I have found that saving and running things in notebooks always takes a tad longer than you think it should.</i></p>"

    "question": "Anatomy of a Notebook",
    "answer": "<img src='images/Anatomy of a Notebook.png' alt='Labeled portions of a notebook. You will use the Run and File buttons at the top when you are ready to use the code. The initialization code is at the top of the Notebook in the first cell. Each box of code is a cell. You can add additional cells using the buttons in the bottom right of the starter cells.'>"

  {
    "question": "Initial Code",
    "answer": "<p>ArcGIS Notebooks use Python Code. Let’s add our code now.</p><p>In the first cell (box), you should already see some default lines of code. Delete that information and add the following lines into that cell:</p><div class='code-container'><button class='copy-btn'>Copy Code</button><pre><code>import os\\nimport pandas as pd\\nfrom collections import defaultdict\\nfrom arcgis.gis import GIS\\nfrom arcgis.gis import SharingLevel\\n\\ngis = GIS(\"home\")</code></pre></div><h2>Data Security Note</h2><p>Use <code>gis = GIS(\"home\")</code> in your initial code.</p><p>Do NOT use anything that asks you to put in your username or password in the code.</p>"

  {
    "question": "Kernels",
    "answer": "<p>Kernels are how ArcGIS Notebooks connect to your data.</p><p>The Kernel can 'time out.' When that happens, you might get a pop-up notification like this one:</p><img src='images/kernel disconnect.png' alt='Kernel Disconnection Notification'><p>Just follow the directions. Go to the Kernel menu and select 'reconnect.' Even though it looks scary, this is a minor thing and doesn't break your code!</p>"

  {
    "question": "Making Notes within the Code",
    "answer": "<p>It is <i>really</i> useful to make notes as you create your code. This will help you when you need to revise your content later, as well as if someone else needs to use your code.</p><p>Use the <code>#</code> symbol to tell the code that you are making a note. See how the notes in the example below let you (or anyone using your code) know exactly what is going on.</p><div class='code-container'><button class='copy-btn'>Copy Code</button><pre><code># Update counts\nuser_items_by_year[user.username][academic_year][\"total\"] += 1\nuser_items_by_year[user.username][academic_year][\"tag_count\"] += tag_count  # Add tag count\nuser_items_by_year[user.username][academic_year][\"category_count\"] += category_count  # Add category count\n\n# Count only items that are NOT Web Maps or StoryMaps\nif not is_webmap_or_storymap:</code></pre></div>"

  {
    "question": "Time Codes in ArcGIS",
    "answer": "<p>ArcGIS keeps track of timestamps using <b>Unix</b> time codes. UNIX time (also called epoch time) is a way computers keep track of time.</p><p>Imagine you had a stopwatch that started ticking at midnight on January 1, 1970. That moment is called the UNIX Epoch. Every second that has passed since then is counted — no dates, no months, just a big number of seconds.</p><p>So for example, 0 means January 1, 1970 at 00:00:00.<p>Why Does ArcGIS use UNIX? Well, the reality is that computers better at counting numbers than keeping track of many bits of information. Using a single number makes it easy to compare dates, sort times, or store timestamps.</p><h2>Convert date and time to a UNIX Code</h2><p>Enter UNIX timestamp or date/time:</p><input type=\"text\" id=\"inputTime\" placeholder=\"e.g. 1717245600 or 2024-06-17T09:00:00Z\" style=\"width: 300px;\" /><button id=\"convertBtn\">Convert</button><p id=\"result\"></p><script>document.getElementById('convertBtn').addEventListener('click',()=>{const input=document.getElementById('inputTime').value.trim();let date;if(/^\\d+$/.test(input)){date=new Date(Number(input)*1000);}else{date=new Date(input);}if(isNaN(date.getTime())){document.getElementById('result').textContent='Invalid input.';return;}const unix=Math.floor(date.getTime()/1000);document.getElementById('result').textContent=`Date (UTC): ${date.toUTCString()} | UNIX timestamp: ${unix}`;});</script>"
